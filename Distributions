Binomial Distribution: 
When to use: 
1. When you have only 2 outcomes for a random variable under consideration, success and failure;
2. Independent event, the probability of a event now, does not affect the probability of the event occuring there after


Poisson Distribution.
1. can be used when p is very small (0.01),
2. Is a specific case of binomial distribution
3. ASuumptions:
	 Same as binomial in the sense:
	 Independence of events., occurence of one event does not affect the probabilty of the other occuring\

	 Different from binomial:
	 the number of experiments is far far greater,
	 and the 


 WHEN THERE IS A NEED TO GET MORE GRANUALAR!..
 Granular in the sense, of time frame, say we get the event per hour, that exactly one cat crosses the path., so outcome is 1 if one cat ccrosses in an hour


You are given the expected value, meaning, nmnmū                                                                                        
 Probablityly(F(X=x)) where x = 1, i.e. exactly one cat crosses, (nCx)* p ** x * q ** (n-x).
 here , n is the number of trials in that bigger interval and p is the probability of success in each of those intervals.;

 i.e. n= 1hour, p - probabilty that one cat crosses per hour
 then if 2 cat cross, we still 


 Suppose µ = n * p is the expected value,  us is the mean of distrubiton or the 

NUmber of success in the hour, 
 NOTE: even if  2 cat crosses your path in a minute, the outcome of event is success.

 WHat do you need to do?
 NEED TO GO GRANULAR!, in the event of timeframe
