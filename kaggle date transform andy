The point is to get a number that you can read and easily know what time it represents, e.g. 8121506 refers to 12:15:06 on day 8. So there is a numerical gap between e.g., 8115959 and 8120000, but the times are in the right order, which is what matters

The critical times were obtained by looking at the train and test files, and shifted by one day. For example, the train file ends at 16:00:00 on the 9th, so the first point in time not in the train file is 16:00:01, and we shift back bay a day to get 8160001. (The reason for shifting by a day is to use data during the validation process that are analogous to the data used when making final predictions.) The other times represent, shifted by a day, the beginning and end of the test file and the gaps in the test data.
