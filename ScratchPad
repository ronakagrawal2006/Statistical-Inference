2 ways, just go brute force of the stats class and finish most bits of it.

Topics to cover under fundamentals:
Modeling data distributions: Statistics and probability - Start here  - Required         Pts: 2 
Study design: Statistics and probability - Required												Pts: 2
Random variables: Statistics and probability - cover this quick, basically skim 			Pts: 1  - 1 hr
Sampling distributions: Statistics and probability - this is quick								Pts: 2  - 
Confidence intervals: Statistics and probability - need time here - 							Pts: 2

~ 5 hrs for 9 points: 

Significance tests (hypothesis testing): Statistics and probability - take time here and understand  			Pts: 4	- 2hr
Two-sample inference for the difference between groups: Statistics and probability - have no idea			Pts: 4	- 2 hr
Inference for categorical data (chi-square tests): Statistics and probability - have no idea, but important	Pts: 4+2- 3 hr
Advanced regression (inference and transforming): Statistics and probability - important							Pts: 4+2- 3 hr
Analysis of variance (ANOVA): Statistics and probability - important 														Pts: 8	- 3 hr





Topics to cover as per CV:
LGBM.
Adaboost.
